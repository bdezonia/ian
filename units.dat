# This file defines all unit types used by the program.
# The unit values are specified as comma delimited fields,
# The fields are in the following order:
#   1) NAME
#   2) PLURAL NAME
#   3) ABBREVIATION
#   4) CONVERSION FACTOR: the number of base units per this unit
#        The value can be an equation using up to 2 multiplications
#        and/or divisions
#   5) BASE UNIT
#   6) UNIT TYPE: the family of measurements this unit belongs to
#        There is no restriction on the name of the unit type.
